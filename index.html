        Hello, my name is Eunki Hong. You can call me Daniel.<br>
        I had lived up in Seoul, South Korea for my whole 19 years and moved to the states after high school graudation.<br>
        <br> I am passionate about making creative analyses and implementing algorithms. People who see me for the first time may think
        I'm a quiet person, but this is because I enjoy thinking deeply and listening to other people's opinions.
        I like to actively communicate with people and want to get insight from them.
